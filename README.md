Our Dashboard. With data regarding Air Quality
Group Memebers: Lorenzo Salazar, Connor Welch, Esther Mendoza, Meagan Sierra, Abraham Feyissa. 


Our Data Set project For Group 7 is about Air quality.
We are aggregating air quality throughout the states of Florida, Georgia, Maine, New York, and Virgina. The purpose of this is to help track trends in air quality and see which states are most affected by pollution within the areas. Also, Health risk assesments, air quality readings, and particularly pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, Ozone(O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide identify high risk areas for respiratory and cardiovascualr diseases. 

We are processing vairous forms of data and want to calculate average values and trends over time to see which of the five states that we chose are the most affected by Air Quality and from there we can see what we can do to try prevent it.
